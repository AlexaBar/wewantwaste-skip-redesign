This is a modern, fully responsive redesign of the skip selection experience for WeWantWaste.
Built with React, styled with pure CSS and infused with engaging UI/UX features for both desktop and mobile users.

## My Approach

I focused on modern UI/UX principles while keeping the existing functionality:

- Skip Card Redesign: Each skip option is displayed in an animated flip card with a clean front (image + title) and back (description + pricing ).
- Responsiveness: The app is fully responsive using `grid` and media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Theme Awareness: Dark mode styling with transparent glassmorphism card backs.
- State Management: Minimal use of `localStorage` to persist selected skip data.
- Animations: Framer Motion adds smooth transitions on page elements, buttons, and confirmation steps.
- Maintainability: Code is component-based and readable, using only lightweight tools (no Tailwind or heavy UI kits).

## PROJECT STRUCTURE:

### Frontend Framework:

- Built with React + Vite;
- Custom pure CSS styling;

Cart & Confirmation Page:
